# Healthcare AR management using Azure Data Factory

This Azure Data Factory (ADF) project focuses on processing and transforming data from the healthcare Accounts Receivable (AR) domain to support better business evaluation and decision-making.

## Project Description:

In the Healthcare, **Account Receivable** (amount owed by patients or insurance company) should be managed properly. If there is any delay or uncollectible amount will affect the cash flow of the management. 

Thus, this project helps in understanding the data and helps the business stakeholders to take actions for the better cash flow, such as 

- total bill
- adjustment amount
- amount paid
- Remaining amount in the AR.

These data helps us to analyse the business even more in wide view and take better action for the good cash flow and reduce the collection period.

action could be done:-
- **regular follow-ups**
- **automatedremainders**
